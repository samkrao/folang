FoLang Plugin Linking Exception
=================================

Additional permission under GNU GPL version 3 section 7.

As a special exception, you are permitted to link software that uses
the FoLang public plugin or shared API interfaces with the FoLang
compiler frontend components covered by GPLv3, and distribute your
linked plugin or extension under license terms of your choice,
provided that:

1. Your plugin or extension uses only the published FoLang plugin API/
   shared interfaces (headers, abstract contracts, IPC hooks, or dynamic
   linking points), and

2. Your plugin or extension does not incorporate or embed GPL-covered
   FoLang compiler frontend code beyond that permitted by dynamic linking
   via the published interfaces, and

3. You do not misrepresent your work as endorsed by, derived from, or
   officially affiliated with the FoLang Project unless separately granted
   permission to do so.

This exception does NOT apply to:

– Modifications to FoLang compiler frontend code
– Derivative works of the frontend sources
– Bundling FoLang frontend as part of a closed product where the GPL-
  licensed components are not independently replaceable by the user

Those cases trigger full GPL obligations.

You may therefore distribute closed, commercial, academic, or open-source
plugins without placing them under GPL, as long as they only link against
the permitted FoLang plugin interfaces and do not embed GPL-covered code.

This exception is intended to support a healthy plugin ecosystem while
preserving the freedoms guaranteed by GPLv3 for the FoLang implementation.
