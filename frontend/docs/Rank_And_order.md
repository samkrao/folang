## Rank And Order

  ### Rank
      
        Rank tells you how deeply polymorphic functions can accept polymorphic arguments.

  ### Order

        Order tells you how many “layers” of type functions you have.

  ### FoLang 

     FoLang Supports Rank2 (As Folang Supports CallCC style continuations) and Order2 (As Folang supports Monads, Functos and Applicatives)
